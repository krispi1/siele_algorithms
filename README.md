# Siele Algorithms
This is my playground for learning and writing algorithms, and writing about them.

## For more algorithms here's the link:
[Siele Algorithms repo](https://github.com/krispi1/siele_algorithms)

This repo is a work-in-progress. I will keep posting to it.

I intend to give you concise and accurate information on a 
number of algorithms to help you understand them really fast.

I am also learning in the process of publishing them. So if 
you find any mistake or inaccuracy please be kind, 
fork the repo, clone it, make an edit and make a pull request.

If you have a suggestion, email me on sielekrisp@gmail.com

#### Variable Naming Convention
I prefer to consistently use lowerCamelCase for all my variables.

#### Function Naming Convention
Function names will vary per programming language.
For Python I'll maintain the recommended lower_case style.
For other languages I'll stick to getFunctionName style.
